Galeto's a Django/Python developed order app that was desinged for a friend of mine who sells roasted chicken and needed some sort of simple looking ordering/booking systems for their clients to be able to order in advance their roasted chicken, and collect best time suited. The app meets all the needs of their business and help them to organise better their future sales and avoid waste.

   - ### Agile and Kanban
    GitHub Project Boards and Kanban are instrumental in collaborative project management. Using Kanban methodology, tasks move through stages like "To do," "In progress," "Testing," and "Done," providing a visual representation and limiting work in progress.

  - ### FlowChart
    The flowchart was a very useful tool to plan ahead and understand how to build the application below you can see the chart that was made using the [**Lucid**](https://lucid.co/)

    ![Alt text](static/media/images/GaletosFlowChart.png "flowchart")

  - ### Design Choices
      The idea was to build a a simple "app-based" design with smooth transitions to make the UX even more seamless and intuitive. All the colors and styles were applied with the built in classes provided that can be found on the [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/) documentation.

  ### Future Features
For future features I will definetly implement and disable past dates and out of work hours that I could not implement due the deadline. Also I would do some more UX design when delete or editing and a modal popup that gets a validation from user of their choice. Also a banner when order is created, updated or deleted to give user more assurance of their action. I would also implement and API system that could send a email confirmation to the user and the administrator thar a new order was created

## Technologies Used
I used the following technologies, platforms and support in building my project:
- The application was built in Python.
- The [**Code Institute**](https://codeinstitute.net/) modules/lessons aided my learning and many of the concepts learned were applied in this project.
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Cesargarciajr/bloom-of-life) was used for the project repository.
- [**Code Anywhere**](https://app.codeanywhere.com/) - for IDE and editor of the code.
- [**Django**](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - framework to develop the app and a few other libraries such as athentications system "Allauth" all specified in the requirements.txt file
- [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/) - for design and choices.
- [**Heroku**](https://www.heroku.com/platform) - was used for application deployment.
- [**Elephant SQL**](https://www.elephantsql.com/) - for database.
- [**PEP8CI Validator**](https://app.codeanywhere.com/) - for error and issues with the code
- [**Lucid**](https://lucid.co/) - Flowchart used on readme file.

## Deployment

<details>
<summary>GitHub Deployment</summary>
First of all you need to have a GitHub account and I choose it because it's free and easy to create a repository to host your code and share with others.

- To create a repository you just need to go to the main page at the top right you will see a "+" button just click here and then new repository

- Select the name of the project and a description make it public and then create a repository

- Once you created your repository go the settings section and then click on pages

- Select the Branch as main and then save it.

- Finally, your repository is deployed and it should show you a link so you can share it with others.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Cloning the Repo</summary>

1. Click on the "Code" button near the top right corner of the page.
2. Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL that appears in the box.
Open your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Type "git clone" followed by a space, and then paste the URL you copied in step 3.
4. Press enter to run the command. This will clone the repository onto your local machine.
5. You should now have a local copy of the GitHub repository on your machine.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Forking the Repo</summary>

1. Click the "Fork" button near the top right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.
2. Once the fork is complete, you will be redirected to the forked repository in your account.
3. If you haven't already, clone the forked repository to your local machine using the steps outlined in the previous answer.
4. Make any changes or additions you want to the code in your local copy of the repository.
5. Commit your changes to your local repository using the "git commit" command.
6. Push your changes to the forked repository on GitHub using the "git push" command.
7. If you want to contribute your changes back to the original repository, create a pull request by going to the original repository's page and clicking the "New pull request" button. From there, you can compare your changes to the original repository and request that they be merged.
8. You should now have a forked copy of the GitHub repository in your account, and you can make changes to it and contribute back to the original repository if desired.

</details>

<details> 
<summary>Heroku Deployment</summary>

1. First of all you need to have a Heroku account.
2. From the Dashboard, click "New" - "Create new app".
3. Enter a name for the app. Click "Create App".
4. Connect your GitHub account and select the repository and branch to deploy.
5. When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the Settings tab. The ordering is as follows:
    - heroku/python
    - heroku/nodejs
6. You must then create the followinf Config Varw:
   - PORT. Set this to 8000.
   - DATABASE_URL. Set this to your database url.
   - DISABLE_STATICFILES. Set to 0.
   - SECRET_KEY. Set to your secret key.

## Acknowledgments
This project taught me a lot and helped me put in practice what I have learn throughout the Course specially getting to know more about Django frameworks and libraries. I was happy enough with the results and to be able to develop a real world application for a friend that will use it as a tool to better manage his business. I Thank the opportunity and help I got from all Code Institute Tutors, but special thanks to [**Sarah Collins**](https://github.com/SJECollins) that helped me a lot troubleshooting and explaining to me my questions.
